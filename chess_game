# Initialize the chess board

# Start the game loop
while not board.is_game_over():
    print(board)

print("Result: " + result)



#This script sets up a game loop that continues until the game is over. It prints the current state of the board and prompts the user to enter a move in algebraic notation (e.g. "e2e4"). The move is then applied to the board using the push_san() method. Once the game is over, the result is printed.
This script is just a basic example, you can add many features like GUI, AI, saving/loading games and so on.
